## To discuss

 * RSE prefers an nLTT statistic distribution over just an nLTT statistic mean.
   This does make the analysis more complex
 * RSE in figure 12/130 Mean duration of speciation and (mean)? nLTT statistic, I
   use the *estimated* (from parameters) mean duration of speciation. He suggests?
   that I should use the measured mean duration of speciation
 * How to call $A1$ and $A2$? An incipient species? The collection of A subspecies?
 * I have not set a limit on the maximum amount of taxa simulated in the 
   incipient species tree. Perhaps I should?
 * If the species trees do not differ between oldest and youngest, we may
   get an overrepresentation of that tree, as it is sampled twice. Should this be
   fixed?

## To do

 * Figure 250: the effect of tree size on ESS
 * Add picture that shows how the error is calculated
 * Check mutation rate
